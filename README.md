# LoRa32_Workshop

Some examples for those inexpensive LoRa32 (http://www.heltec.cn/project/wifi-lora-32/?lang=en) you'll get it at AliExpress for example.
There are some different Versions around which aren't not totally pin compatible on some power pins.

I wrote them using the Platform.io plugin on Visual Studio Code, but by copy-pasting the main into Arduino it should run too (I actually didn't test it yet)
